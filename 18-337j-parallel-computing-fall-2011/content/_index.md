This is an advanced interdisciplinary introduction to applied parallel computing on modern supercomputers. It has a hands-on emphasis on understanding the realities and myths of what is possible on the world's fastest machines. We will make prominent use of the [Julia Language](http://julialang.org/), a free, open-source, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.
